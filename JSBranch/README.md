# Idea
This point of sale is very simple, it will allow to create a calculation of the cost of a product. Instead of the classic barcode, we are using the number of the product to search.
There will be a calculator and delete bar for the products.
It will behave as a shopping cart instead of a POS, still the name of this project is YeriU Point of Sale (Client requisites).

# Logic 
Here we can find the happy paths about the various application workflows
 
# Main Flow
- Vendor start the application
- Search for a product or introduce the number of the product (Product ID)
- The system will show the product (a message will appear if the product is not found)
- The vendor will add the product to shopping cart
- The shopping cart will show the total amount of the products
- The vendor can add or remove products 
- The system will share a ticket with the products and price
