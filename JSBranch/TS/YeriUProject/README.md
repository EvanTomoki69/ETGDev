# Yeri Universe POS

# This application was made by love (and non-paid development sessions) for my lovely wife Alexandra, I hope that I can support all your future projects.

# Idea
This point of sale is very simple, it will allow to create a calculation of the cost of a product. Instead of the classic barcode, we are using the number of the product to search.
There will be a calculator and delete bar for the products.
It will behave as a shopping cart instead of a POS, still the name of this project is YeriU Point of Sale (Client requisites).
It will look and feel like a shopping cart, and it is, in fact, a shopping cart, because now my wife is going to use it as an stand alone shopping car for her website(life is crazy).

# Logic 
Here we can find the happy paths about the various application workflows
1. Select a product:
The client can click on the + button of the product and the product will be added to the shopping cart.
2. Select a higher quantity of a single product:
The client can click on the + button of the product and the products will be added to the shopping cart.
3. Select multiple products
The client can click on the + button of the product and the products will be added to the shopping cart.
4. Delete a product
The client can click on the - button of the product and the product will be removed from the shopping cart.
5. Delete multiple products
The client can click on the - button of the product and the products will be removed from the shopping cart.
6. Check cart status
The client can click on the shopping cart and check the selected products.
7. Empty cart
The client can click on the Empty Cart button and erase all the selected products.[]

# Main Flow
- Vendor start the application
- Search for a product or introduce the number of the product (Product ID)
- The system will show the product (a message will appear if the product is not found)
- The vendor will add the product to shopping cart
- The shopping cart will show the total amount of the products
- The vendor can add or remove products 
- The system will share a ticket with the products and price
